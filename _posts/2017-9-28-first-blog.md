title: Data Analysis Algorithms Review

This blog reviews the machine learning alogrithms in a very generitic way.

## Model Complexity vs Generalisation

* Over-fitting and Under-fitting
* Generalisation Performance
* Regularisation

## Model Selection

* Validation Set
* K-Fold Cros-Validation
* Leave-One-Out Cross Validation

## Two major approaches to machine learning

* A probabilistic approach
* Bayesian approach

## The gradient Descent Algorithm
Gradient descent is an algorithm that minimizes functions. Given a function de䅢Ⰰned by a set of parameters, gradient descent starts
with an initial set of parameter values and iteratively moves toward a set of parameter values that minimize the function. This iterative minimization is achieved using calculus, taking steps in the negative direction of the function gradient.
Two approaches are:
* Batch gradient descent
Update the parameter vector per batch
* Stochastic gradient descent
Update the parameter vector per data point

## Bias-Variance Analysis
Error = Bias + Variance

Let's rock!
