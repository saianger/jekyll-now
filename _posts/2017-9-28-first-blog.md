## Model Complexity vs Generalisation

* Over-fitting and Under-fitting
* Generalisation Performance
* Regularisation

## Model Selection
* Validation Set
* K-Fold Cros-Validation
* Leave-One-Out Cross Validation

## Two major approaches to machine learning
* A probabilistic approach
* Bayesian approach

Let's rock!
